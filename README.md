Network Performance Evaluation Repository

Welcome to the Network Performance Evaluation Repository! This repository contains resources for analyzing and optimizing network performance using Cisco Packet Tracer and Wireshark.

Repository Contents:
1. Topology Configuration (Cisco Packet Tracer File):
  `miniproject.pkt`: This Cisco Packet Tracer file includes the configured network topology. Open this file in Cisco Packet Tracer to visualize and simulate the network environment.

2. Wireshark Capture Analytics:
   Wireshark Folder: This folder contains Wireshark capture files (.pcapng) for three distinct connections in the network: R1-to-SW1, SW1-to-SW2, and SW2-to-WS1.

Getting Started:
1. Topology Configuration:
     Open `miniproject.pkt` using Cisco Packet Tracer.
     Simulate the network to observe communication patterns.

2. Wireshark Analysis:
     Explore the Wireshark folder.
     Open the Wireshark capture files corresponding to the desired connection for in-depth analysis.

Analyzing Capture Files:
  $  Each capture file provides insights into packet counts, sizes, and protocols for the specific network connection.
  $  Use Wireshark's features to filter, dissect, and interpret the captured packets.
  $  Identify patterns, anomalies, or areas for optimization based on the analysis.
